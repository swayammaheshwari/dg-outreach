            <h3>Submission Guidelines:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Original Content:</strong> All submissions must be original and exclusive to our website. We
                    do not accept articles that have been published elsewhere or content that infringes upon copyright
                    laws.</li>
                <li><strong>Relevance:</strong> Please make sure your article aligns with our website's topics and
                    interests. We aim to provide our readers with valuable information that is both engaging and
                    relevant.</li>
                <li><strong>Word Count:</strong> We recommend articles to be between 800 and 1500 words. However, the
                    focus should be on providing insightful and well-researched content rather than meeting a specific
                    word count.</li>
                <li><strong>Structure:</strong> Please organize your article into clear sections with headings,
                    subheadings, and bullet points when appropriate. This enhances readability and allows readers to
                    navigate the content more easily.</li>
                <li><strong>Language and Style:</strong> Write in a clear, concise, and engaging manner. Use proper
                    grammar, spelling, and punctuation. Feel free to incorporate your own unique voice and writing style
                    to make your article more compelling.</li>
                <li><strong>Citations and Sources:</strong> When referencing data, statistics, or quotes, please provide
                    appropriate citations and list your sources at the end of the article. This ensures accuracy and
                    maintains the integrity of the information presented.</li>
                <li><strong>Images:</strong> If you include images or infographics, please ensure they are relevant to
                    the article and that you have the necessary rights and permissions for their use. Provide image
                    credits when applicable.</li>
            </ol>
